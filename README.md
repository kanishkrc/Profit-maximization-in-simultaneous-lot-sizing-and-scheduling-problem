# Profit-maximization-in-simultaneous-lot-sizing-and-scheduling-problem
This project introduces a novel approach to Simultaneous Lot-sizing and Scheduling Problems, focusing on profit maximization as the primary objective. Unlike traditional models that emphasize meeting all customer demands, which may not fully align with actual business objectives, this model optimizes production planning specifically for profitability.

The proposed model accommodates a flexible demand range, allowing accepted demand to vary within predicted (upper) and minimum required (lower) limits for each period. This flexibility supports more effective decision-making on accepted demand, lot-sizing, and scheduling, all within a unified model framework.

The objective function maximizes the difference between sales revenue and production costs, inventory holding, and setup costs. The model provides optimal accepted demand levels for each product in each period and the size and sequence of production batches. By integrating medium-term product mix planning with short-term lot-sizing and scheduling, this approach offers a comprehensive solution for production planning.
